# 3-bit-adder
3-bit adder with triple seven-segment display (inputs and sum).

These are photomasks for a negative lithography process using "blue film" available on markets like AliExpress and eBay. These are meant to be printed on transparency film so that black toner will inhibit UV curing of the photomask and etch resist. 

If you print these for use with toner transfer paper, they *MUST* be inverted.

Print at A4, 100% scaling. US Letter or 93% fit-to-page scaling will not work.

BOM includes: 
* 2x 7486 XOR gates
* 2x 7408 AND gates
* 1x 7432 OR gate
* 1x LM7805 linear VRM
* 3x 7447 BCD to 7-segment drivers
* 3x 0.56" CA 7-segment displays
